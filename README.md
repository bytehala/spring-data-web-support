## Notes

Spring Data web support has _resolvers_ that *reduce boilerplate* and make our controllers more expressive.

Resolvers
 - interoperate with Spring Data Repositories
 - can fetch domain objects without explicitly calling the repo implementations
 - can construct controller responses that support pagination and sorting
